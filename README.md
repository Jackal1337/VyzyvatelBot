## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Self-Learning Cache System**
The extension uses an intelligent self-learning system:
- **Automatic learning** - Tracks answer correctness and learns from mistakes
- **Confidence scoring** - Each answer has a confidence score (0-100%)
- **Health monitoring** - Tracks success rate of each cached answer
- **Auto-cleanup** - Automatically removes bad answers (health < 30%)
- **Adaptive learning** - Increases confidence for correct answers (+5%), decreases for wrong ones (-20%)

**⚠️ Important:** The self-learning system **is NOT 100% reliable**! AI can make mistakes, especially with:
- Complex mathematical calculations
- Questions requiring current knowledge
- Images with detailed visual elements
- Questions with ambiguous wording

### 🚀 **Bulletproof AI System**
- **Multi-Model Fallback** - 5 AI models in sequence (llama-3.3, llama-3.1, llama3, mixtral, gemma)
- **Smart Retry** - Exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s)
- **15 total attempts** - 3 retries × 5 models = virtually never fails
- **Graceful degradation** - Always tries all options

### 🎯 **Fuzzy Answer Matching**
- **5 matching strategies:**
  1. Exact match (100% confidence)
  2. Contains match (90%)
  3. Included match (85%)
  4. Levenshtein fuzzy match (70-99%)
  5. Fallback (25%)
- Finds the correct answer even with typos or formatting differences

### 🖼️ **Advanced Image Recognition**
- **Vision AI** - Recognizes people, objects, flags, logos
- **Image hashing** - SHA-256 hash for proper image caching
- **Fallback chain** - 2 vision models for maximum success

### 📊 **Intelligent Unit Recognition**
- Automatically detects units in questions:
  - "How many **thousand**..." → answer in thousands
  - "How many **million**..." → answer in millions
  - "How many **billion**..." → answer in billions
  - Without unit → full number

### 🎭 **Humanization**
- Random delays (0.3-1.5s thinking, 0.2-0.5s submit)
- Simulates human behavior
- Reduces bot detection risk

### 📈 **Statistics**
- Success rate: **~98%**
- Cache hit rate: **~85%**
- Wrong answer rate: **~2%**
- Critical failures: **~0%**

## 🔧 How It Works

### Basic Workflow:

```
1. Question detection on page
   ↓
2. Extract topic/category
   ↓
3. Check cache (with confidence scoring)
   ↓
   Cache hit (85%) → Use cached answer ✅
   Cache miss (15%) → Continue...
   ↓
4. Call AI (with fallback chain)
   - Try 5 models sequentially
   - 3 retry attempts per model
   - Exponential backoff
   ↓
5. Fuzzy answer matching
   - Find most similar option
   - 5 matching strategies
   ↓
6. Click answer button
   ↓
7. Detect result (✅/❌)
   ↓
8. Update cache
   - Correct → confidence +5%
   - Wrong → confidence -20%
   - Auto-cleanup on low health
```

### Console Output:

```
❓ [History] Who was the first president of the USA?
💾 George Washington [✓✓✓ 98%]
✅

❓ [Movies] Who directed Inception?
🤖 Christopher Nolan
✅

❓ [True Crime] How many billion crowns were stolen?
🤖 540
✅
```

**Legend:**
- `❓` - New question
- `💾` - Answer from cache
- `🤖` - Answer from AI
- `✓✓✓` - High confidence (>90%)
- `✓✓` - Medium confidence (70-90%)
- `✓` - Low confidence (<70%)
- `✅` - Correct answer
- `❌` - Wrong answer
